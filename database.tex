My goal is to make a database all the functionality in the EIOtraining website. First the database needs to store the EIOtraining users data. It also needs to store the news and the problemset entries. It's users will be mainly problem creators who create programming problems, and users who solve them. This database is necessary for the EIOtraining website to work, because users, news and prolemset entries need to be stored somewhere.

The database model looks like this:

The database has been already implemented for the EIOtraining website and sample operations are available in the code.
